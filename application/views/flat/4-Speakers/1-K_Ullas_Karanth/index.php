            <p><strong>K Ullas Karanth,</strong> 
            originally trained as an engineer, in order to pursue his deep passion
            for wildlife, started studying tiger ecology in India, obtaining his Master’s Degree from
            University of Florida, USA (1988) and PhD from Mangalore University, India (1993). He
            is the Director for Science-Asia at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), as well as an
            adjunct professor at NCBS-TIFR and Manipal University. Karanth has worked extensively
            on tiger and prey ecology, and has published over 150 scientific papers and several books
            including <i>The Way of the Tiger, A View from the Machan</i> and <i>Science of Saving Tigers</i>. His
            areas of interest are carnivore ecology, modelling of wildlife populations, and conservation
            policy and advocacy. Karanth was elected Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in
            2008. He was awarded the Sierra Club’s International Earth Care Award in 2006, WWFs
            J. Paul Getty Award in 2007 and Bombay Natural History Society’s Salim Ali Award for
            Lifetime Achievement in 2009. He is also a recipient of the Rajyothsava Award of the
            Government of Karnataka in 2010 and the Padmashree in 2012.

                    Networks of identically coupled nonlinear oscillators can in some circumstances spontaneously  split into subgroups with different dynamical characteristics. In the simplest examples, there are two subgroups, one of which is fully synchronised while the other is desynchronised; more complex dynamical patterns are possible. Chimeras were first discovered in numerical studies, but have, in the past two decades, been seen in a number of experiments, and are believed to underlie interesting physiological states such as uni-hemispheric sleep that sea mammals and birds experience. Other situations where such states of broken symmetry may be relevant include ventricular fibrillation, and the so-called bump states in neural networks. The origin of the symmetry breaking that gives rise to such complex spatiotemporal patterns and the current interest in these phenomena will be discussed.
